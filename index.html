  <h2>JavaScript Scope</h2>

  <p>Scope is an important topic in JavaScript and can be quite confusing to language newcommers. In this post I will be discussing scope and how it affects access to variables in different scopes.</p>

  <p>The global scope is the outermost level of scope. Variables created in this scope can be accessed from anywhere in the program.</p>

  <p>When a function is created, a new scope is also created. Everything inside the curly brackets is contained within the scope of that function. Inside this scope we have access to all the variables created outside of the scope. However, any variables created within this function cannot be accessed from the outside scope.</p>

  <p>The scope created within functions also includes any values passed in as paramaters when the function is called. These can be used anywhere within this functions scope.</p>
